# ⏱️ Time Conversion Tool

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Time Conversion Tool** is a simple C program that converts a given number of seconds into a readable **HH:MM:SS (Hours:Minutes:Seconds)** format.  
This project is designed for beginners to understand basic time calculations and core C programming concepts.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Convert total seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds
- Display the output in a clean and readable format
- Practice arithmetic operations and user input handling in C

---

## 🛠️ Project Utility
This tool is useful in many real-world applications such as:
- Digital clocks and timers  
- Game time tracking  
- System logs and performance monitoring  
- Embedded systems and automation projects  

It helps convert raw time data into a human-friendly format.
